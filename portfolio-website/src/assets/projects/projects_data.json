    "Description": "Building on concepts introduced in the book \"The Elements of Computing Systems\" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, I designed the required circuitry, and simulated it using Python- from basic AND gates, to RAM, to the CPU.\nFeatures an interactive GUI to stop and start the CPU clock, and see memory states.",

    "Description": "Enamoured with the way games were able to convert three-dimensional points to two-dimensional objects on a screen, my research led me to a series of matrix operations. Because of Python's inherent slow speed, I used highly optimized vector math libraries, which required complete refactoring of my approach. Currently, only .obj files are supported.",
